# facility_location_implementation
In  this  facility  location  problem  you  are  given  as  input  a  set V of  points  in  a  Euclidian  space.Specifically, you are given 500 points in 2D space.  Each point represents one of the top 500 largestUS  cities  in  terms  of  population.1So,  you  will  be  given  a  text  file  which  has  the  coordinates(latitude and longitude) of one of the cities in each line.You’re allowed to open a facility at any point inV, but have to pay costffor opening eachfacility;  here we assume that all facilities have the same opening cost,f.  (Later, we will discusshow to set the value off).  The goal is to choose a subsetF⊆Vand open facilities at each locationinF, and assign every point inVto one of the open facilities, so as to minimize total opening costplus the total connection cost.
