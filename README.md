An implementation of an instance of a k-median and facility location problem. 500 of the US Largest cities' Longitude and Latitude are inputted via 500_us_city_coords.txt. A 1-swap local search algorithm and its facility location approximation is implemented in localSearch.ipynb. A 4 and 6 LP approximation is located in flmip.py, phase 1 of the primal dual solution is in dps.ipynb, while phase 2 of the primal dual solution is in dps.py. The solutions have not been integrated, but are very nearly implemented.
