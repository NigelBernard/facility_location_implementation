An implementation of an instance of a k-median and facility location problem. 500 of the US Largest cities' Longitude and Latitude are inputted via 500_us_city_coords.txt. A 1-swap local search algorithm and its facility location approximation is implemented in localSearch.ipynb. A 4 and 6 LP approximation is located in flmip.py, and phase 1 of the primal dual solution is in dps.ipynb.
